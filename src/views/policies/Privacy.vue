        As of March 20, 2019, the only data collected by The Diol App Team is analytical data for this website.
        This could potentially change in the future, and if you use our app (once it launches), then we will be
        sure to send out notifications via the app to let users know when our Privacy Policy changes. If you want
        to be sure you are in the know, however, then please feel free to sign up for our Privacy Mailing List
        using the form located at the bottom of this page, so you will recieve an email each time the Privacy
        Policy is updated.

        As for specifics on what data is collected. We use Google Analytics, which collects the following
        (source <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsTrackingOverview#trackingCodeExecution">Google LLC</a>):
        <ul>
          <li>Our Google Analytics ID</li>
          <li>All cookies associated with the request for the page</li>
          <li>Information regarding how many times/for how long you are on our site</li>
          <li>The language encoding for your web browser</li>
          <li>The title of the page</li>
          <li>The version of Adobe Flash your browser is running</li>
          <li>The hostname of the request (Google's side of the request)</li>
          <li>Whether or not your browser is Java enabled</li>
          <li>The page you requested from our site</li>
          <li>The complete URL you visited, including referrers</li>
          <li>The color depth and resolution of your screen (web browser)</li>

        While this is a lot of information, the majority of this information is simply what
        is sent to Google and we have no access to that information. For more information

        What data we do collect, we collect so that we can help improve our website and the content on it. We know
        it sounds clich√©, but that's the honest truth. We honestly use very little of the analytical data collected
        by Google Analytics. What we are concerned with is what led a user to our site, and then we build upon that
        information to drive more users to our site, so we can share our app with the world.

      <h5 class="headline" id="can-i-control">Can I control what data is collected?</h5>
      <p class="body-1">
        The answer to this question is a bit complicated. You can control whether analytics data is or is not
        collected; however, you cannot do so directly. It would be very technically complicated, and involve cookies
        and GDPR issues if we allowed users to opt in and out of analytics. With that said, you can still stop us
        from collecting analytical data about your visits by simply using private mode on your web browser, or
        many ad blockers have the ability to block Google Analytics requests. There is no fear here for ad blockers
        either. We do not now, nor will we ever run ads on this site, and we will never add anti-ad blocker scripts
        to this site. We believe in being open and honest, and you can make the decision that is best for you.
