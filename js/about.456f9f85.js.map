Well, I ain't gonna go easy on ya. I am going to\n          assume you understand how to work with Git, Android Studio, and Java. Any issue tagged with\n          <code>help wanted</code> is fair game, just reply to the issue to let us know that you are going\n          to work on it and we will remove the tag so we don't have multiple people trying to work the same\n          issue. That said, there are a few major things that still need to be done:\n          <ul>\n            <li>The code needs to be cleaned up...alot...Google's code is really, REALLY messy</li>\n            <li>All of the translations need to be merged in (trust me this takes a LONG time), there are 84 of them</li>\n            <li>Some strings need to be translated because they are not correct, since they refer to Google</li>\n          </ul>\n          All in all though, the app is mostly ready for release. In the beginning, it will only be released\n          in the United States and Canada until we have the issues relating to translations ironed out. I don't\n          want to release the app in any country that the app is not translated to work in.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A note to code contributors. Please, please, PLEASE, do <b>NOT</b> take it upon yourself to add new\n          features without warning. Please, open an issue, or post in the Gitter chat, in the Developer's Lounge,\n          and well will discuss the feature and potentially open a poll in the Community to see if that is indeed\n          a feature that would work well with the app. We will notify you directly, add a Github milestone for\n          your feature and assign you to it, if your feature will be added. Then, at that point, you can fork\n          the repo and begin working on your new feature. Also, PLEASE DO NOT create new branches for features.\n          This repo will run only 1 branch...master.\n        </p>\n\n        <v-layout align-center wrap row>\n          <v-flex xs-12 md-6>\n            <v-btn flat large disabled>\n              <v-icon left>fab fa-github</v-icon>\n              Github Repository\n            </v-btn>\n          </v-flex>\n          <v-flex xs-12 md-6>\n            <v-btn flat large disabled>\n              <v-icon left>fab fa-gitter</v-icon>\n              Gitter Chat\n            </v-btn>\n          </v-flex>\n        </v-layout>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <hr />\n    <br />\n\n    <div class=\"pa-3\">\n      <h3 class=\"display-2 pb-2\">Contributing to the cause</h3>\n      <p class=\"body-1\">\n        If you wish to donate, but lack the technolocial skills to get down and dirty with\n        it, that's okay, you can always contribute monetarily.
